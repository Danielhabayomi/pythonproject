# Chinook Database Analysis
Chinook Database Analysis using SQLite and Pandas

Task 1: Analyzing Invoices by Country
Connect to the Chinook database and use the Invoice table to determine which
countries have the most invoices. Provide a table of BillingCountry and the number
of invoices, ordered by the number of invoices for each country. The country with
the most invoices should appear first.

Task 2: Identifying the City with the Best Customers
We aim to host a promotional Music Festival in the city where we've made the
most money. Write a SQL query to find the city with the highest sum of invoice
totals. Return both the city name and the sum of all invoice totals.

Task 3: Sales Time Series Analysis
Create a time series of total sales by month. This will involve grouping sales
data by month and summing up the total sales for each month.
Similarly, create a time series for total sales by month specifically for the Rock
genre. This will require you to join tables to filter sales by the Rock genre
before performing the time series analysis.

Task 4: Sales Forecasting
Using the time series data created in Task 3, apply any forecasting technique to
predict the total sales for the next 6 months.
